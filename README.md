Application was designed as **Mobile-First**, with minimal styling for the component itself.

All the different styling, which are only relevant for certain screen-widths, were inserted into relevant media-query mixin (closed range if possible).

The goal is maximizing performance for mobile, while improving the overall performance for all devices.
